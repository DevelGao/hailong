# Getting Started with Hailong

After you download and unpackage Hailong:
1. At the command line, change into the `hailong-<release>` directory. 

2. To display the command line help:
    ```json
    ./bin/hailong --help
   ```

A [basic quickstart](https://github.com/devgaoEng/hailong/wiki/Quickstart) and other options for [starting Hailong](https://github.com/devgaoEng/hailong/wiki/Starting-Hailong) are included in the documentation. 

The documentation is included in this release package and on the [Hailong Wiki](https://github.com/devgaoEng/hailong/wiki). 

>**Note** Starting Hailong by double-clicking the `hailong` or `hailong.bat` executables starts a node synchronizing with the Ethereum mainnet.
